+
+**DEFINITIONS**
+
+For the purposes of this Agreement:
+
+**"Distributed Ledger System"** means a decentralized digital infrastructure that enables the secure, transparent, and immutable recording of transactions or data across a distributed network of computers (nodes). It operates as a shared ledger using cryptographic techniques, ensuring trust without relying on central authorities.
+
+**"Company Accounts"** means the accounts or Smart Contracts at the following addresses on the Sui Network: the DAO Contract address specified in Article V.1, and any other addresses determined from time to time to hold property of the Company by the Futarchic Management System or the Member.
+
+**"Futarchic Management System"** or **"Futarchy"** means Govex's onchain algorithmic governance framework that implements futarchy as a decision-making methodology, using market-based conditional mechanisms to determine organizational outcomes. Under this system, proposed actions are evaluated through conditional markets, and the action associated with the market outcome reflecting the highest predicted organizational value shall be deemed approved and is contractually binding, implemented automatically via Smart Contract or pursuant to the Company's governance procedures.
 
-**WHEREAS**, in pursuit of compliance with a fit-for-purpose legal regime that seeks to protect members and support innovation, the founder of the Company approved the incorporation of the Company as a Marshall Islands for-profit limited liability company and decentralized autonomous organization. 
+**"Governance Token"** or **"$GOVEX"** means the token at address 0x0f5a49f57d89b812eface201194381d5c81b462f39b90b220a024750737ea5d4::govex::GOVEX on the Sui Network. Holding the Governance Token confers Market Participant status but does not confer membership, ownership, or any economic interest in the Company.
 
-**NOW, THEREFORE**, for and in consideration of mutual covenants contained and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:
+**"Market Participant"** means any person or entity that holds Governance Tokens and interacts with the Futarchic Management System.

+
+**"Smart Contract"** means any executable bytecode persistently stored on a Distributed Ledger System for operation by validators, sequencers, or other Distributed Ledger System nodes.
+

+
+**WHEREAS**, the sole Member of the Company desires to establish an algorithmically managed company that follows the outcomes of its Futarchic Management System, while retaining emergency powers to protect the Company's operations.
