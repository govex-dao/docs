**OPERATING AGREEMENT OF GOVEX DAO LLC**
(ALGORITHMICALLY MANAGED DAO LLC)

**EFFECTIVE 18th January 2026**

**NOTICE OF RESTRICTIONS ON DUTIES AND TRANSFERS**

*The rights of members in a decentralized autonomous organization may differ materially from the rights of members in other resident domestic or non-resident domestic limited liability companies. The DAO Act, underlying smart contracts, certificate of formation, and limited liability company agreement (i.e., the operating agreement), if applicable, of a decentralized autonomous organization may define, reduce, or eliminate fiduciary duties and may restrict the transfer of ownership interests, withdrawal or resignation from the decentralized autonomous organization, return of capital contributions and dissolution of the decentralized autonomous organization.*

This Operating Agreement **("the Agreement")** of Govex DAO LLC, a limited liability company and decentralized autonomous organization **(the "Company" or the "DAO")** incorporated as per the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands pursuant to the Marshall Islands Limited Liability Company Act of 1996 (as amended, the **"LLC Act"**), the Marshall Islands Business Corporations Act (as amended, the **"BCA"**) and the Decentralized Autonomous Organization Act, 2022 (as amended, the **"DAO Act"**), by the sole Member executing this Agreement, is effective as of 18th January 2026 (the **"Effective Date"**).

All accepted proposals executed under the Futarchic Management System for the Company up to and including the execution date of this document shall remain in effect and contractually binding upon the Company.

---

**DEFINITIONS**

For the purposes of this Agreement:

**"Distributed Ledger System"** means a decentralized digital infrastructure that enables the secure, transparent, and immutable recording of transactions or data across a distributed network of computers (nodes). It operates as a shared ledger using cryptographic techniques, ensuring trust without relying on central authorities.

**"Company Accounts"** means the accounts or Smart Contracts at the following addresses on the Sui Network: the DAO Contract address specified in Article V.1, and any other addresses determined from time to time to hold property of the Company by the Futarchic Management System or the Member.

**"Futarchic Management System"** or **"Futarchy"** means Govex's onchain algorithmic governance framework that implements futarchy as a decision-making methodology, using market-based conditional mechanisms to determine organizational outcomes. Under this system, proposed actions are evaluated through conditional markets, and the action associated with the market outcome reflecting the highest predicted organizational value shall be deemed approved and is contractually binding, implemented automatically via Smart Contract or pursuant to the Company's governance procedures.

**"Governance Token"** or **"$GOVEX"** means the token at address 0x0f5a49f57d89b812eface201194381d5c81b462f39b90b220a024750737ea5d4::govex::GOVEX on the Sui Network. Holding the Governance Token confers Market Participant status but does not confer membership, ownership, or any economic interest in the Company.

**"Market Participant"** means any person or entity that holds Governance Tokens and interacts with the Futarchic Management System. Market Participants are not members of the Company and have no ownership interest, economic rights, governance rights beyond market participation, or fiduciary protections.

**"Smart Contract"** means any executable bytecode persistently stored on a Distributed Ledger System for operation by validators, sequencers, or other Distributed Ledger System nodes.

**WHEREAS**, the sole Member of the Company desires to establish an algorithmically managed company that follows the outcomes of its Futarchic Management System, while retaining emergency powers to protect the Company's operations.

**NOW, THEREFORE**, the sole Member agrees as follows:

**ARTICLE IV**

**MARKET PARTICIPANTS**

IV.1 **Status of Market Participants.** Persons or entities holding Governance Tokens are Market Participants. Market Participants are expressly **NOT** members of the Company. Holding Governance Tokens does not confer any:

(a) Membership interest or ownership stake in the Company;
(b) Economic rights, profit-sharing rights, or rights to distributions;
(c) Voting rights in the Company (distinct from market trading);
(d) Fiduciary duties owed to them by the Company or Member;
(e) Rights upon dissolution of the Company;
(f) Standing to bring derivative actions on behalf of the Company.

IV.2 **Nature of Market Participation.** Market Participants interact with the Futarchic Management System by trading in conditional markets and submitting proposals. This participation constitutes use of a protocol, not investment in or ownership of the Company. Any gains or losses from market trading result from the Market Participant's own trading activity, not from the efforts of the Company or its Member.

IV.3 **No Reliance.** Market Participants acknowledge that they have no expectation of profit derived from the efforts of the Member or the Company. Market Participants participate at their own risk and are responsible for their own trading decisions.

IV.4 **Disclaimer of Fiduciary Duties.** To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Company and the Member owe no fiduciary duties to Market Participants. Market Participants' sole rights are those arising from their interaction with the Smart Contracts comprising the Futarchic Management System.

IV.5 **Restricted Persons.** It is the policy of the Company to comply with applicable sanctions regimes. Persons subject to United Nations targeted financial sanctions or residents of embargoed regions (Iran, Syria, Cuba, North Korea, Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk) are prohibited from being Market Participants.

**ARTICLE V**

**MANAGEMENT**

V.1 **Algorithmic Management.** The ordinary and usual decisions concerning business affairs of the Company shall be determined by the Futarchic Management System. Proposals are submitted to and adjudicated by the Smart Contract for market-governed proposals (the **"DAO Contract"**) located at:
