# 10 Open Questions in Futarchy

1. What is a fair sponsorship threshold? Enough to give statistical confidence the decision wasn't noise?

2. Is it legal / fair / moral to trade in decision markets that directly impact you? Require disclosure before trading? [More here](https://medium.com/collab-currency/7-lessons-testament-of-a-futarchy-trader-2d7cc43b1323).

3. What actions is futarchy alone not suitable for? [Umbra Research](https://www.umbraresearch.xyz/writings/futarchy) flags custodial relationships, e.g. lending protocol upgrades.

4. Is it a slow rug if team doesn't work for the LLC that owns the IP, or a company 100% owned by that LLC?

5. Does futarchy require open-book management? How much information do LLC governance markets need?

6. Should markets have the right to dictate implementation details of a task?

7. Legal IP structure: founder veto on IP transfers? IP returns to founder if DAO winds down in year one? Independent arbitrator for gross negligence?

8. Should we build for AIs or human entrepreneurs? Who are the new elites? ([Hanson originally raised](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/we-need-elites-to-value-adaption) adoption-by-elites as a core barrier to futarchy.)

9. [Commitment issue](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/futarchy-details) (Hanson): No incentive to price proposals REJECT/ACCEPT differently if they can be recreated a day later. Should there be cultural norms for the core team to only sponsor unique proposals? No duplicate proposals within a short time frame?

10. Do teams have a moral obligation to sponsor legitimate proposals that can't reach threshold on their own?
