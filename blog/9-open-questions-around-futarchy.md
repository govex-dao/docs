9 Open Questions around Futarchy

1) What is a fair team sponsorship percentage. 99% confidence interval that decision wasn't random noise?

Does it depend on founder shoudl we just start it at +-3 % for everyone. Do team have a moral imperative to set most deicions to 0% threshold if its not clearly malicious?

2) Is it legal / fair / moral to trade in decision markets that directly impact you? Maybe founder must just disclose all information before.

(link to Arad stuff maybe his psot or a blog)

3) What actions is futarchy alone not suitable to handle? Umbra research e.g lending protocol upgrades.

4) Is it a slow rug if team doesn't work for LLC that owns that IP or a company that is 100% owned by the IP LLC

5) Does futarachy require open book management? Market information etc. How much information do the markets need.

6) Should the markets be expected to / have the right to dictate the implementation details of any task.

7) Futarchy and legal IP structure: I have been thinking for the launchpad the legal structure should be set up such that founder should have legal write to veto all IP transfer to third parties. I DAO winds down in frirst year founder gets IP back. Need maybe independant pre approved arbitor for gross negligence cases?

is it even realistic to

8) Build for AI's or for humans tech entrepeneurs? Who are the new elites ( hanson futarchy adoption by elites problem core issue with futar)

9) Commitment issue hanson ( no incentive to price proposals reject accept differntly if can be recreated redacted a day later).
Should have clutral more for core team to only sponsor a unique proposals. Not duplicate proposals within a shot time frame??

10) Do teams have moral obligation to sponsor proposals to 0 twap threshold that are not attacks.
