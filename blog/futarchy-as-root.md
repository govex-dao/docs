# Two Models for Futarchy Adoption

*Stacking threshold effects vs diminishing marginal returns*

**Diminishing marginal returns**

- Futarchy only for treasury and token minting
- Founder controls operations, strategy, etc
- Markets govern capital, humans govern execution
- Going further adds complexity without proportional benefit

**Stacking threshold effects**

- Each domain has its own overhead stack
- Partial futarchy in a domain = keep that domain's full overhead
- 100% futarchy in a domain = delete that domain's stack
- Thresholds compound as you cross them:
  - 100% treasury → delete finance committee, budget meetings
  - 100% hiring → delete HR approval chains, hiring committees
  - 100% strategy → delete board, strategic planning dept
  - 100% ops → delete middle management
  - 100% everything → delete upper management
- Diminishing returns predicts smooth tapering; this predicts step functions

**Precedents:**

*FANUC robot factory:*

- Robots building robots, 50 units per 24-hour shift [1]
- Runs unsupervised for 30 days at a time [1]
- "Not only is it lights-out, we turn off the air conditioning and heat too" [2]
- Can't do 90% automated—if humans are present, you need lighting, HVAC, break rooms, safety officers
- 100% automated = delete the stack entirely
- Futarchy parallel: replace workers with robots, replace managers with market pricing

*High-frequency trading:*

- Algorithmic decisions in microseconds [3]
- Human reaction time: 200-300 milliseconds [4]
- By the time a human clicks OK, the opportunity is gone
- HFT now accounts for 50-70% of U.S. equity volume [3]
- Futarchy parallel: waiting for board ratification of what markets already priced = operating at human speed, forfeiting market benefits

**The philosophical split:**

- Diminishing returns: Stop at treasury. Complexity outweighs benefit.
- Stacking thresholds: Each domain cleared = another stack deleted. Keep going.

**Why this matters over the next 5 years:**

- AI agents executing at senior-employee level [5][6][7]
- "Why is a human the bottleneck?" becomes obvious question
- Typed actions (structured, machine-readable proposals) gives legibility for agent coordination
- Arbitrary bytes (opaque instruction execution) means markets can't price what they can't parse
- The organizations that make markets root will operate at market speed; the rest will operate at human speed
